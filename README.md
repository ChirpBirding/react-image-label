## Dependencies

The package is dependent on [SVG.js](https://svgjs.dev/docs/3.1/) through [react-svgdotjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-svgdotjs) package. The following peer dependencies must be specified by your project in order to avoid version conflicts:
[`react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react),
[`react-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom).
NPM will not automatically install these for you but it will show you a warning message with instructions on how to install them.
